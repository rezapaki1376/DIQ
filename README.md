# Tasks

1) Variables Types
— 10 experiments with different combinations of numeric, categoric and boolean features
— Note that dataset.make creates only numeric dataset
2) Duplication (not-exact)
— 10 experiments with different % similarity: for example, creating and adding non-exact duplicated rows, based on a fixed similarity measure
— For one experiment: varying % duplicated rows, for example from 5% to 50% (with an increasing step of 5%) of duplicated rows
